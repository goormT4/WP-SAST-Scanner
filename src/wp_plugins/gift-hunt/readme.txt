## Best practices to run a successful Gift Hunt session on your WordPress site

Make sure that your visitors know about it. You can use your announcement bar to display a “notification” to your visitors about the Gift Hunt session running on your site.
If you collected subscribers previously, you can send them an email about this limited opportunity.

Drive visitors from social media to your site while your Gift Hunt session is active. The chance, that users who visit your site will become customers during a Gift Hunt session is much higher than on regular visits. So try to drive as much traffic to your site as possible, while your session is active.

Give your visitors "real gifts", otherwise they’ll think that you just collected their personal information to send them promotional messages later. Try to avoid this and let them feel that they really got some valuable gift in exchange for their data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The Gift Hunt icon is not showing up on my website. What could be the problem? =

If you tested the gift hunt session by collecting a gift, you've been marked as a user who already collected a gift and the icon won't be visible to you. Clear the cookies in your browser or use a private window to test your session.

It's also possible that your session is not active. Check your settings on the backend of your website.

If you chose the option to give unique gifts for every visitor it is also possible that you ran out of gifts. Check the hunters of your session to figure this out.

If none of the above solved your problem, please, get in touc with us.

= What happens if I remove the plugin from my site? =

If you remove the plugin from your site, all sessions and collected user information will be removed from the database right after you removed the plugin.

Get in touch with your hosting provider. Probably they can give you a backup from the database where the collected information is still available.

No, all session data and collected user information got removed from the database when you confirmed the delete request. Get in touch with your hosting provider. Probably they can give you a backup from the database where the collected information is still available.

= I don’t want to collect any user information, is it possible to turn it off? =

The way Gift Hunt works, this is not possible. Collecting some user information is mandatory.

= Can I change the design of the popup? =

The [pro version of Gift Hunt](https://gifthuntplugin.com/) comes with a few pre-defined popup templates. Inf the free version you can use additional CSS to change the layout of the popup. You have to add your additional CSS to the stylesheets of your theme. If you need help to do it, feel free to get in touch with us.

= Can I change the design of the success email? =

You can use custom HTML to do that and in the [Pro version of the plugin](https://gifthuntplugin.com/), you can find some pre-defined templates.

= What happens if I choose the option to use "give a unique gift to every visitor" and I run out of gifts? =

If you run out of gifts, Gift Hunt won’t display the session icon for new visitors. If you run out of gifts while someone is filling the data collection form, the form will disappear when they submit it.

= It looks like that someone collected more than one gift even though multiple gift collection is not turned on. How is this possible? =

Gift Hunt is using cookies to identify visitors who already collected gifts in a given session. If someone removes these cookies, or using another browser or device to visit your site, they can collect additional gifts.

= Will the session icon automatically pop-up after a user spent the defined amount of time on the website? =

No, the icon will become visible when the visitor hits refresh or visits another subpage of your website.

= When I preview the gift hunt session it doesn’t use the latest version of the settings I defined. Why is that happening? =

Make sure that you saved your changes before you click on preview. If you saved your changes but the result is still the same, wait a few minutes and try it again.

= Can I use my own icons for a session? =

This is only possible with the [Pro version of the plugin](https://gifthuntplugin.com/).
